// This file's content is intentionally left empty to ensure it does not define
// an active page route, which would conflict with the required catch-all route
// src/app/(sites)/[...siteSlug]/page.tsx and the site root handler src/app/(sites)/page.tsx.
// An optional catch-all [[...siteSlug]]/page.tsx cannot coexist at the same level
// as a required catch-all [...siteSlug]/page.tsx.
